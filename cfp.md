# Call for Papers

The submission deadline was extended to **9 October 2020 (23:59 AoE)**.

| **Submission**          |[https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2020/Workshop/TDA_and_Beyond](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2020/Workshop/TDA_and_Beyond)|
| **Deadline**            |Friday,  ~~2~~ **9** October 2020 (23:59 AoE)|
| **Author notification** |Friday, 30 October 2020 (23:59 AoE)|

We welcome all original research papers of up to 4 pages in length,
using the template provided [below](#style). This length does not include
references or any supplementary materials. Reviewers are *not* obliged
to read supplementary materials when reviewing the paper.  Submissions
should be a single file in `.pdf` format. The review process is
*double-blind*, so please ensure that all papers are appropriately
anonymised.

We also welcome extended abstracts of up to 2 pages in length that
describe open problems, novel applications, or challenges in
*Topological Data Analysis*, *Topological Machine Learning*, and related
areas&nbsp;(using the template provided [below](#style)). Again, this length does
not include references or any supplementary materials.

We also permit papers that have been recently published or are under
submission to another venue. Please mark such papers accordingly upon
submission. The page limit for these submissions is 4 pages.

Accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as brief talks
of 5--7 minutes length. Authors will also have the option to present
their work in a live session.

This workshop is **non-archival**; even though all accepted papers will be
available on OpenReview, there are *no* formally-published proceedings.

# Style

We only accept submissions that have been prepared using LaTeX. Use the
following workshop style files for your submission (the PDF file is
provided as a preview of the expected style):

- [neurips_2020_tda.tex](/assets/neurips_2020_tda.tex)

# Scope and topics

Please find a list of topics of interested, sorted alphabetically. If
you are not sure whether your topic might be a good fit for the
workshop, feel free to contact us at [workshop@topology.rocks](mailto:workshop@topology.rocks).

-   **Approximations**: Can we approximate parts of the computational
    pipeline, for example when calculating Vietoris--Rips complexes and
    their associated filtrations, or when calculating distances between
    persistence diagrams?

-   **Benchmark data sets and software**: What are suitable benchmark
    data sets to quickly compare different TDA methods in a reproducible
    manner? What is 'our' MNIST or CIFAR data set? How do the existing
    software tools for TDA measure up, and how do we address the
    software needs?

-   **Beyond persistent homology**: What other machinery from topology
    can be applied to machine learning, beyond persistent homology? How
    do we address the methodological and computational challenges?

-   **Connections to learning theory**: How can topology help in
    understanding complex models such as neural networks? How can we use
    this understanding to uncover the underlying principles of
    generalisation in the context of neural networks? How can we design
    appropriate regularisation strategies to encourage beneficial
    properties of learned mappings?

-   **Current and future applications**: In which projects and
    applications do topology-based approaches have a decisive 'edge' over
    alternative approaches, and how to identify this 'niche'
    methodically?

-   **Feature descriptors**: How can we employ persistence diagrams in
    unsupervised or supervised machine learning scenarios? How can we
    improve their integration into our frameworks?

-   **Higher-dimensional features**: In many applications, we limit the
    dimension of topological features. What can we say about
    higher-dimensional features? When are they suitable? How can we
    approximate these efficiently?

-   **Scaling and parallel processing**: How can we scale TDA to the
    data set sizes that we encounter in machine learning?

-   **Statistical approaches**: What can we say about confidence
    estimates of topological features, in particular when there is an
    element of stochasticity in the input data generation?

-   **TDA for evolving machine learning areas**: How do we develop and
    use TDA approaches for evolving fronts of ML such fair/explainable
    ML, causality, meta-learning, or adversarial examples (note that
    this is not an exhaustive list; TDA methods have cropped up in all
    of these domains)?

-   **Time-varying topology**: What are suitable characterisations of
    time-varying topological features? What kind of computational tricks
    can we use to speed up their calculation? What is a good perspective
    to analyse dynamical systems with TDA?
