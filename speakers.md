| **Topological obstructions to neural networks' learning** |
| We apply topological data analysis tools to studying loss surfaces of neural networks. This is a joint work with G. Sotnikov, A. Korotin, D. Oganesyan, D. Emtsev, E. Burnaev. |

| **Biography** | Serguei Barannikov received his PhD in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley (1999). He is a leading research scientist at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. He also holds a position as a CNRS researcher at Paris Diderot University.  He worked as a researcher in mathematics at Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques and at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris.  At the age of 20, Barannikov wrote a paper on algebraic topology, in which he introduced "canonical form" invariants of filtered complexes, together with an efficient algorithm for their calculation. Ten years later, these invariants became widely used in topological data analysis under the name of "persistence barcodes" and "persistence diagrams". Dr. Barannikov's recent interests focus on applying  topological data analysis methods to reveal patterns in learning of neural networks. | 

## Ulrich Bauer

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/ub.jpg" alt="Ulrich Bauer" height="250px" /> |
| **The Representation Theory of Filtered Hierarchical Clustering** |
| In recent years, several fields in mathematics have sprung up in order to deal with the analysis of large data sets. Topological data analysis is one such field, providing ways of assigning topological invariants to discrete data sets. Perhaps the main example, persistent homology, is well understood and closely related to the representation theory of the Dynkin quiver A~ n. By allowing for an extra parameter, one is led to consider filtered hierarchical clustering methods.  These methods give rise to representations of a commutative grid, whose structure maps in one direction are all epimorphisms. This talk will describe this subcategory by means of a cotorsion torsion triple coming from a tilting object. In particular, this allows us to determine the representation type! This talk is based on joint work with M.B. Botnan, S. Oppermann, and J. Steen. |

## Lorin Crawford

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/lc.jpg" alt="Lorin Crawford" height="250px" /> |
| **A Machine Learning Pipeline for Feature Selection and Association Mapping with 3D Shapes** |
| It has been a long-standing challenge to implement an analogue of variable selection with 3D shapes as the covariates in a regression model. Here, we present SINATRA, a statistical pipeline for sub-image selection where the goal is to identify the physical features of 3D shapes that best explain the variation between two trait classes. A key insight is that, one can use tools from differential topology to transform objects represented as meshes into a collection of vectors (with little to no loss of information about their natural structure).  Since this topological transformation is invertible, SINATRA uses an interpretable machine learning algorithm to map significant vector indices back onto the original shapes — thus, highlighting the physical 3D shape characteristics that best distinguish members in the two groups. As an application of our pipeline, we conduct feature selection on a dataset consisting of mandibular molars from five different genera of New World Monkeys and examine the physical properties of their teeth that best characterize their dietary regimens. |

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/btf.jpg" alt="Brittany Terese Fasy" height="250px" /> |
| **Searching in the Space of Persistence Diagrams** |
| The doubling dimension of the space of persistence diagrams is infinite and, as a result, current approaches for finding the nearest neighbor to a persistence diagram among a set of other persistence diagrams is either linear in the number of diagrams or does not offer performance guarantees.  This talk will present the first algorithm that supports approximate nearest neighbor search in the space of persistence diagrams using the bottleneck distance. |

## Yasu Hiraoka

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/yh.jpg" alt="Yasu Hiraoka" height="250px" /> |
| **Characterizing rare events in persistent homology** |
| Indecomposables obtained through decompositions of persistent homology are regarded as topological summary of real data. However, as is well known, there exist pathologically complicated indecomposables in multi-parameter persistent homology in purely algebraic setting, and this fact makes it difficult to build mathematical theory on that setting. Our fundamental question is, how much should we care about such complicated indecomposables in the real data, and what is a suitable framework to study this question? To this aim, we will show several ongoing results, especially, (1) large deviation principle on 1 parameter persistent homology, and (2) law of large numbers on multi-parameter persistent homology. Then we will discuss how these two results (partially) answer to the original question. |

In addition to materials science, he has recently launched TDA projects on other application areas such as life science and economics. |

## Lida Kanari

| **A topological insight on neuronal morphologies** |
| The morphological diversity of neurons supports the complex information-processing capabilities of biological  neuronal  networks.  A  major  challenge  in  neuroscience  has  been  to  reliably  describe neuronal shapes with universal morphometrics that generalize across cell types and species. Inspired by algebraic topology, we have developed a topological descriptor of trees that couples the topology of  their complex  arborization  with  their  geometric  structure,  retaining more  information  than traditional morphometrics. The topological morphology descriptor (TMD) has proved to be very powerful in separating neurons into well-defined groups on morphological grounds. The TMD algorithm led to the discovery of two distinct  morphological  classes of  pyramidal  cells  in  the  human  cortex  that  also  have  distinct functional roles, suggesting the existence of a direct link between the anatomy and the function of neurons. The TMD-based classification also led to the objective and robust morphological clustering of rodent cortical neurons. Recently we proved that the  TMD  of  neuronal morphologies  is  also  essential  for  the  computational  generation (i.e., synthesis)  of  dendritic  morphologies.  Our  results demonstrate  that  a  topology-based  synthesis algorithm  can reproduce  both  morphological  and  electrical  properties  of reconstructed  biological rodent  cortical  dendrites and generalizes well to  a  wide  variety  of different  dendritic  shapes. Therefore it is  suitable  for  the  generation  of  unique  neuronal  morphologies to populate the digital reconstruction of large-scale, physiologically realistic networks. |

She has been developing algorithms based on mathematical principles, including topology, Markov models and stochastic processes, to model and reproduce neuronal shapes. Lida has a MSc in Applied Mathematics and Physics and a MSc Computational Fluid Mechanics from the National Technical University of Athens, Greece. She was awarded her PhD from EPFL in Computational Neuroscience. |

| **Spatiotemporal Persistent Homology for Dynamic Metric Spaces** |
| Characterizing the dynamics of time-evolving data within the framework of topological data analysis (TDA) has been attracting increasingly more attention. Popular instances of time-evolving data include flocking/swarming behaviors in animals and social networks in the human sphere. A natural mathematical model for such collective behaviors is a dynamic point cloud, or more generally a dynamic metric space (DMS).  We show how to extend the Rips filtration stability result for (static) metric spaces to the setting of DMSs, while retaining stability. We identify polynomial time computable invariants and associated pseudodistances, and provide software implementations which can be used for practical tasks. This is joint work with Woojin Kim (Duke) and Nate Clause (OSU); see <https://github.com/ndag/PHoDMSs>. |

## Liz Munch

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/em.jpg" alt="Liz Munch" height="250px" /> |
| **Persistent homology of complex networks for dynamic state detection in time series** |
| There has been extensive work performing time series analysis with persistence diagrams via the Takens embedding. In this talk we develop an alternative approach for studying graph representations of time series of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show how persistent homology can be used to yield a compressed, multi-scale representation of the ordinal partition network of the time series that can distinguish between dynamic states such as periodic and chaotic behavior. By replacing the network with its persistence diagram, we then extract existing as well as new geometric and entropy point summaries from the persistence diagram and compare to other commonly used network characteristics. Our results show that persistence-based point summaries yield a clearer distinction of the dynamic behavior and are more robust to noise than existing graph-based scores, especially when combined with ordinal graphs. |

## Don Sheehy

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/ds.png" alt="Don Sheehy" height="250px" /> |
| **A Sparse Delaunay Filtration** |
| In this talk, I will discuss how a filtration of Delaunay complexes can be used to approximate the persistence diagram of the distance to a point set in $\R^d$.  Whereas the full Delaunay complex can be used to compute this persistence diagram exactly, it may have size $O(n^{\lceil d/2 \rceil})$. In contrast, our construction uses only $O(n)$ simplices.  The central idea is to connect Delaunay complexes on progressively denser subsamples by considering the flips in an incremental construction as simplices in $d+1$ dimensions.  This approach leads to a very simple and straightforward proof of correctness in geometric terms, because the final filtration is dual to a $(d+1)$-dimensional Voronoi construction similar to the standard Delaunay complex. |

| **Wasserstein Stability for Persistence Diagrams** |
| The stability of persistence diagrams is among the most important results in applied and computational topology but most results are with respect to the bottleneck distance between diagrams. This has two main implications: it makes the space of persistence diagrams rather pathological and it is often provides very pessimistic bounds with respect to outliers. In this talk I will discuss new stability results with respect to the p-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. The foundations are cellular stability functions on sufficiently finite spaces in terms of the p-norm of the perturbations. This has applications to image analysis, persistence homology transforms and Vietoris-Rips complexes. This is joint work with Primoz Skraba. |

## Bei Wang

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/bw.jpg" alt="Bei Wang" height="250px" /> |
| **Topology and Neuron Activations in Deep Learning** |
| Deep convolutional neural networks have become ubiquitous in image classification tasks thanks to architectures such as GoogLeNet and ResNet. However, we do not quite understand how these networks achieve their impressive performance. The main challenge in deep learning is the interpretability: How can we make the representations learned by these networks human interpretable? Given a trained deep neural network, we can address the interpretability issue by probing neuron activations, that is, the combinations of neuron firings, in response to a particular input image. With millions of input images, we can obtain a global view of what the neurons have learned by studying neuron activations at a particular layer and across multiple layers.  We aim to shed light on the following questions using topological tools: What is the shape of the activation space? What is the organizational principle behind neuron activations? |

## Yusu Wang

| <img src="/assets/images/speakers/yw.jpg" alt="Yusu Wang" height="250px" /> |
| **Discrete Morse-based graph reconstruction and data analysis** |
| In recent years, topological and geometric data analysis (TGDA) has emerged as a new and promising field for processing, analyzing and understanding complex data. Indeed, geometry and topology form natural platforms for data analysis, with geometry describing the ''shape'' and ''structure'' behind data; and topology characterizing / summarizing both the domain where data are sampled from, as well as functions and maps associated to them.  In this talk, I will show how the topological objects from discrete Morse theory and persistent homology can be used to reconstruct hidden geometric graphs, and how they can be then combined with machine learning pipelines for further data analysis tasks in both low and high dimensions. This talk is based on multiple projects with multiple collaborators and references will be given during the talk. |

In 2006, she received a DOE (Dept. of Energy) Career award, and an NSF (National Science Foundation) Career award in 2008. She is on the editorial board for SICOMP, JoCG, and CGTA; moreover,  she currently serves on the Computational Geometry Steering Committee.  Yusu primarily works in the fields of Computational geometry, applied topology, as well as topological and geometric data analysis (TGDA). Her work lies at the intersection of computer science (especially algorithms) and applied mathematics (especially applied topology, discrete and combinatorial geometry). She is particularly interested in developing effective and theoretically justified algorithms for data / shape analysis using geometric and topological ideas and methods, as well as to integrate such methods with machine learning frameworks.  Yusu aims to both provide theoretical understanding of various computational methods developed, and to apply them to practical domains, including computational biology, computational neuroanatomy, material science, computer graphics and visualization. |

| **Industrial Application of TDA-ML technology**: Achievement so far and expectations of future |
| As DX (Digital Transformation) has been becoming a big key word among almost all industrial players, AI practitioners got many chances to tackle more complex data, which they've not met before. Topological Data Analysis has been recently attracting attention of AI practitioners/Data scientists. Because, TDA would have a great potential to extract hidden features, which current technologies have not successfully found, from complex data by combining with ML technologies.  In this session, I present several industrial use cases of TDA-ML and show TDA-ML capability, which would provide great benefit to DX industries. |
